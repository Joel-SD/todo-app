## This is a ToDos app 'in progress'

In this app I use next js 13, redux toolkit to fetch the data, I normally use Axios but being a small app it is the fastest option, I also make the data persist using local storage, if you are seeing this with practically no styles , it is because I will be doing several other functionalities before moving on to that part in which I will be applying Tailwind or Sass.


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
